    ```

3. **Set up the database:**
    - Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running.
    - Create a new database.
    - Run the SQL scripts located in the `sql` directory to set up the necessary tables.
    - Use the `base.sql` file from the `sql` folder to restore the backup:
      ```bash
      psql -U your_username -d your_database -f sql/base.sql
      ```
    - Alternatively, you can query the code inside `base.sql` directly in your PostgreSQL client.
